# Introduction

[TopMTG](https://topmtg.herokuapp.com/) is an application for Magic The Gathering players to build their own trading card decks. This app caters to building Commander decks, which is the most popular playing format of the most popular card game. Commander restricts players to have only one copy of each card. Users are able to search all 29000+ cards pulled from the scryfall API to quickly add cards to their deck. They can also create their own decks, and comment on others. This project was created by Peter Mace as a full stack capstone project for App Academy.
